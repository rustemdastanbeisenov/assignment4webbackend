# Weather & Cooking Demo App

This project was made as an assignment for WEB Technologies (Backend) and showcases usage of various APIs.

## Usage

- Install all the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash npm install```
- Start the server by running the following command. The server runs on port 3000:
```node app.js```
- Go through the following link to use the application:
```http://localhost:3000/index```

## Information

- The FatSecret API does not work unless you're added to the API Whitelist (that's how the API works, sadly)
- The quiz is not localized
- All passwords are encrypted by bcrypt
- Users, quizzes, and the items added through the Admin Panel (from the REST API assignment requirement) are all stored in my MongoDB cluster

## Dependencies

This application uses the fatsecret and Foodish APIs for its main page.
